        <h1>A Theoretical Analysis of My Personality</h1>

        <div class="category">
            <h2>Psychodynamic Theory</h2>
            <p><span class="underline">ID, Ego, Superego:</span> ID: Desires to scroll on social media. Superego:
                Looking upon my future endeavours and acknowledging the finite amount of time we have.
                Actively calculating cost-benefit analysis. Ego: Helps balance my academic ambitions with relaxation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="underline">Defense Mechanisms:</span> I use rationalization when facing failure. Some
                examples include: "It's only a loss if I sell, I'll just wait if I need to." (investing loss).
                "I'm not a good test taker, that's why I didn't do well." (test exam failures), "If I didn't have ADHD,
                I'd be academically superior!"
                (externalizing failure), and "I almost had it! Next time Iâ€™ll definitely win it back.. 99% of gamblers
                quit just before they hit it big, right!?" (gambling). </p>
            <p><span class="underline">Unconscious Thoughts:</span> I tend to be friendly and treat strangers as if I've
                known them for a long time because
                I have a warm and positive outlook on people I don't know.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Key Figure:</span> Sigmund Freud, is the founder of psychoanalysis, and
                contributed key aspects
                like the id, ego, superego, and defense mechanisms. Freud's idea of defense mechanisms, such as
                rationalization, relates to my personality.
                I tend to rationalize failures, which may be the origin from the unconscious mind, protecting me from
                feelings of anxiety. This aligns
                with Freud's view of how we cope with our internal conflicts without fully being aware of them.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Personality Theory Question:</span> Do we have free will or is our personality
                determined by outside forces?
                We clearly do have free will, and the instances provided above details that our free will dictates how
                we enforce our personality.
                There could defintely be some potential unconscious variables which combined with outside forces, enact
                us to do things beyond our own control.
                But for the most part, we do have free will. It is up to us to self-reflect and consciously examine our
                thinking, taking a listen to our subconscious thoughts,
                and by doing so, gain a deeper understanding to question, and rationalize. Rationalizing our
                rationalization, aligning it with "objective" accuracy.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">Evaluating Personality:</span>The unconscious is my favorite concept from this
                theory because we don't fully know what is going on
                in our unconscious. I find it interesting because in order to understand our unconcious, we can't just
                take a quick look at it. We need external variables like our
                our habits, our social attitues, measurements of our self, and our subjective reticent data into
                something objective, through the big five, TAT, and more. The most simplest
                way is through journaling, as it forms a feedback loop on our internal instruments.</p>


            <p><span class="underline">TAT results:</span> LIWC analysis shows a slightly below-average "Need for
                Achievement" (4.34)
                and average "Need for Affiliation" and "Power" (1.7), suggesting moderate focus on success and
                relationships.
                High use of social (19.06) and positive emotion words (3.96) reflect social awareness and optimism,
                despite darker undertones.
                The absence of self-references hints at emotional distance, while above-average use of complex words
                suggests a sophisticated,
                thoughtful writing style. Overall, your narrative balances ambition, relationships, and deeper
                existential questions.</p>

        <div class="category">
            <h2>Humanistic Theory</h2>
            <p><span class="underline">Self-Concept:</span> Hardworking, disciplined, and tend to interact and simulate
                with my conscious thoughts. From conversations to thought experiments to ruminations.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Ideal vs. Real Self:</span> Motivates me to grow, giving me clarity from
                differentiating whether or not I'm making objective progress or subjectively illude.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Unconditional Positive Regard:</span> I value relationship(s) that fundamentally
                holds the basis of acceptance and support of a person regardless of what the person
                says or does. By doing this, I strongly believe it unlocks the ability for communication to deepen and
                the potential to understand mutually and alternate perspectives, but only if the former is satisfied.
            </p>
            <p><span class="underline">Key Figure:</span> Carl Rogers is an American psychologist who was one of the
                founders of humanistic psychology, best known for developing person-centered therapy.
                His significant contributions consisted of self-actualization, self-concept, and unconditional positive
                regard.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">Personality Theory Question:</span> Is our personality stable/consistent or can
                it change? I firmly believe that our personality has significant potential to change.
                Although temperaments are biological, the higher layers of personalities can be changed depending on the
                environment and experiences.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">Evaluating Personality:</span>I find the concept of self-actualization, regarding
                the process by which an individual reaches his or her full potential, and self-concept, an idea of
                the self constructed from the beliefs ones holds about oneself to be intriguing. Acknowledging the
                process of fully developing and using one's abilities towards their objective(s) is such a unique
                motivating factor we individually. </p>


            <p><span class="underline">Self-Actualization results:</span>The top three sources of my Self-Actualization:
                Peak Experiences, Truth Seeking, and Purpose. Peak Experiences at 15, Truth Seeking at 15, Purpose at
                14, Authenticity at 14, Humanitarianism at 14, Good moral intuition at 14, Equanimity at 14, Acceptance
                at 13, Continued Freshness of Appreciation at 11. Creative Spirit at 11. </p>

        <div class="category">
            <h2>Trait Theory</h2>
            <p><span class="underline">Openness:</span> I am very open, scored high, as I love learning about new things
                and opportunities.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Conscientiousness:</span> Strong, it keeps me disciplined and maintains my morals
                aligned with what I believe.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Neuroticism:</span> Moderate, as I have specific mechanisms and techniques in
                place to manage stress.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Key Figure:</span> Gordon Allport, who was an American psychologist. He was one
                of the first psychologists to focus on the study of the personality, often referred to as one of the
                founding figures of
                personality psychology.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">The Big 5 Results</span> Open-Mindedness (83rd percentile), Conscientiousness
                (75th percentile), Extraversion (75th percentile), Agreeableness (82nd percentile), Negative
                Emotionality (54th percentile)</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Evaluating Personality: Myers Briggs Personality Test (16 personalities)
                    results</span>ENFJ. (Protagonist) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling,
                and Judging traits. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas
                and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals.
                To answer the question, Do we have free will or is our personality determined by outside forces? I do
                think we have free will in this case. It is a combination of both, but our free will helps determine our
                own abilities and rationalize judgement.
                For example, I can agree with this personality trait aligns with me because if I specifically attribute
                an instance of me, I tend to be highly empathetic, which can be a con in certain situations. </p>

        <div class="category">
            <h2>Social-Cognitive Theory</h2>
            <p><span class="underline">Reciprocal Determinism:</span> My habits tend to influence my motivation. This is
                why I prioritize habits over motivation, as motivaton is fleeting while habits always stay. It's
                concrete.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Locus of Control:</span> Internal, believing effort leads to success. We all need
                an intenral locus of control or we lose clarity in ourself, in our abilities, in our self-worth. </p>
            <p><span class="underline">Self-Efficacy:</span> High, as past successes drive me. This also drives
                motivation, as working hard and achieving milestones supplement my trajectory.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Key Figure:</span> Albert Bandura, explains how people learn behaviors and skills
                by observing and imitating others.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Evaluating Personality:</span> Is our personality a result of nature or nurture?
                Personality is a combination of both nature or nurture. It is extremely delicate and hard to
                distinguish, but some aspects of nurture is the way we objectively act,
                towards certain situations. Especially with reciprocal determinism, it consists of three, continuously
                interacting variables or determinants.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <strong>In a nutshell,</strong> each theory offers a different view of my personality. Various perspectives and multiple disciplines help me narrow down which
            aspect I want to focus on and analyze. I can then use these distinct aspects to reiterate: reflect, grow,
            and adapt in life.
